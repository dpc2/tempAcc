# Temperature Accuracy data processor
Similar to the DCIR calculator script, this is a Pyton script
written to automate data processing at an old job. It reads in
an xlsx file generated by test equipment and scans one of the
columns to determine relevant data points. Then it performs a
simple difference calculation between two temperature readings
at 6 different set points, and returns the result of those
calculations in an output xlsx file.
This operation is then performed on any other xlsx files in the
same directory.
